# Orinix
A fully fledged, simulated OS, developed by the same one person who made WSCE

# Comming Soon!

## What to expect?
Orinix, (despite the name) is not based on linux, nor windows, it is it's own simulated OS, for windows only, it will share filesystems and will run ontop of windows, yet will still feel, look, and behave like its own operating system, it will come with a cd command (nav) an exit command (shutdwn) a clear command (clearscr) a credits command (credits) and a notepad (aurora)

## When will it release? 
Hopefully sometime next week, or if im quick maybe even 2 days
